<p>In my original setting, I would like to offer user choices in choosing the soup, side_dish and noodles for ramen options and different types of sushi in the same form.</p>
<p>After doing more research and building the page, I realise that it would be too complicated so I simplified the number of options for users to choose.</p>
<p>I have also added a login and sign off function using django allauth functionality.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>I tested that this page works in different browser such as: Chrome, Microsoft-edge, Firefox.</p>
<p>I confirmed the project is responsive, look goods and function on all standard size screen using devtool device tool bar.</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<h2>Validation Testing</h2>
<li>***HTML: No error was found using official W3C Validator.</li>
<li>CSS: No error was found using official W3C Validator.</li>
<li>Accesssibility: I confirm the design and layout of the page is easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.
